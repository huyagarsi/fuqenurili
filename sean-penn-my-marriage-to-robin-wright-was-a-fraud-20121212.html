(The pair wed in 1996 and divorced in 2010; Penn was also married to <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Madonna</a> </strong>from 1985 to 1989.)</p><p>“There is no shame in saying that we all want to be loved by someone. As I look back over my life in romance, I don’t feel I’ve ever had that,” the Gangster Squad star says. “I have been the only one that was unaware of the fraud in a few of these circumstances blindly.”</p><p>Although the actor doesn’t mention Moneyball star Wright, 46, by name, Penn confesses the couple was forced to acknowledge some uncomfortable facts about their relationship during the drawn-out divorce process.</p><p>“When you get divorced, all the truths come out, you sit there and go, ‘What the f— was I doing? What was I doing believing that this person was invested in this way?’ Which is a fantastically strong humiliation in the best sense,” he says. “It can make somebody very bitter and very hard and closed off, but I find it does the opposite to me.”</p><p>Things took a turn for the worse following Penn’s split from Wright: less than one year later, their son Hopper, 19, was involved in a serious skateboarding accident. (The pair are also parents to daughter Dylan, 21.)</p><p>“It had already been eight months of divorce and s–t, and raising a kid that’s going through the divorce himself, and then this f—ing thing happens . . . it was a tough, tough time,” Penn confesses.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>When everything else in his life felt bleak, the actor says his Haiti activism helped put things — including his heartbreak and his son’s accident — into perspective.</p><p>“The road started with the most obvious kind of trauma — my son’s head — and then to get to a place that had been just so devastated and traumatized, and then to see that in fact most of the trauma actually predated the earthquake,” the founder of J/P Haitian Relief Organization shares. “You had a country that had never experienced anything that related to comfort, and out of that you had great trauma — but also this great strength that, I think, we all benefited from.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasnZGjerGxzadkprFdoq6zvsianp5lpKR6s7vBoqVmr6KetKnAjLCYrGWRYrOzrdSdZGtoYWd%2Bc32RaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
