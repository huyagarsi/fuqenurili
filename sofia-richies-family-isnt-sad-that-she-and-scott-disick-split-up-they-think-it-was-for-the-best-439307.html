Us Magazine reported this week that Sofia’s family thinks their split was for the best.</p><p>Sources claim her family is encouraging her to worry about her own life, especially amid the quarantine lockdown. Scott is busy raising his children with Kourtney Kardashian, whereas Sofia is still working as a model and also starting her own companies.</p><p>As it was previously reported in July, Disick and Richie broke up for the second time amid the summer of 2020. They first started dating in 2017 but broke up in May as he was about to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">enter a treatment facility for his prior traumas.</a></p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CFc5WSlASvb/</p><p>Even though Scott and Sofia had “great chemistry,” her family wasn’t a fan of him right from the start, which was always a big deal to Sofia. The insider described her as a “family girl,” and she values the opinion of them the most.</p><p>It wasn’t that long ago that Lionel Richie expressed his reluctance over his daughter’s relationship with a man who is 15 years her senior. He described it as a “phase,” and claimed he was just going to sit back and wait for it to play out.</p><p>Lionel claimed that he now understands what it was like for his parents to hear him say he was in love with another girl, but the age gap between them was obviously a whole other issue. Another source who spoke with Us Magazine said the age difference played a crucial role in their decision to split.</p><p>For instance, Scott is winding down at this point in his life. He’s more focused on his various businesses and investments, whereas Sofia is just starting. As most know, Scott already has three children with Kourtney Kardashian, including Mason, Reign, and Penelope, and the final season of KUTWK&nbsp;was recently announced.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Even though the couple has broken up, Scott and Sofia have been on great terms. For instance, he wished her a Happy Jewish New Year on the 21st of September.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGejpLOqrYyroJygmZrAbrLApqClsV2ewK%2FAjKyYnWWkna61edKhnGaZnpl6tK%2FOratmnJmotqS3jKynpaGkYsKxedOhnLJlpJ22r7eMoqtmr5Goeqe70WaroZ1dl7K0wIxtanJrYGx8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
