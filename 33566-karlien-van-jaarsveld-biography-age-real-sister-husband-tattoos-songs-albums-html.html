She was born on December 21st, 1985, in Paarl, South Africa to a musical family. Both her parents sing as well as her brother. Karlien's mother was also her former manager, Ronel Brink.</p><p class=align-left>She is the oldest of three, the closest to her in age being her brother, and then their sister comes last.</p><h2>Karlien van Jaarsveld siblings</h2><p class=align-left>Karlien van Jaarsveld brother is <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Pieter van Jaarsveld</a>, who is also a musician and actor like Karlien. Professionally, Pieter goes by the stage name, Bobby van Jaarsveld, a nickname he was given as a baby after his father. Bobby and Karlien work a lot together, and they even have a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">reality series that was recently renewed</a> for a new season.</p><p class=align-left>Bobby van Jaarsveld wife is known as Annatjie van Jarrsveld. They got married in January 2011 and have two sons; Sion and Leben, and a daughter; Armani.

She was the lead singer in this group, and Karlien admits that she learned a lot from being in the group at the time. We reckon that she wanted to shine on her own, because in 2008, she left the group to pursue her solo music career. This was a good move on her part because her music gets a lot of traction and is very popular with many people. It has led to her being nominated and winning several awards.</p><h3>Karlien van Jaarsveld nominations include</h3><p class=align-left>For the Tempo Awards in 2011:</p><ul><li>Best newcomer</li><li>Best female artist</li><li>Best pop album</li></ul><p class=align-left>For the Ghoema awards:</p><ul><li>Best pop album 'Jackal's Wedding with Wolf's Woman.'</li><li>Best female artist</li><li>Music video of the year 'Jackal's Wedding with Wolf's Woman.'</li><li>Song of the year 'Jackal's Wedding with Wolf's Woman.'</li><li>Album of the year 'Jackal's Wedding with Wolf's Woman'</li></ul><h3>Karlien van Jaarsveld winning awards include:</h3><ul><li>Best female artist</li><li>Music video of the year</li><li>Best pop album</li></ul><h2>Karlien van Jaarsveld albums</h2><p class=align-left>A list of some of Karlien van Jaarsveld's albums over the years:</p><ul><li>Sing vir Liefde</li><li>Jakkals Triu Met Wolf Se Vrou</li><li>Uitklopha</li><li>My Hartjie</li><li>Die Beste Tot Nou</li></ul><h2>Karlien van Jaarsveld songs</h2><ul><li>Hande</li><li>Sing vir Liefde</li><li>Sweet dreams</li><li>Jakkals Trou Met Wolf se Vrou</li><li>Better as Liefde</li><li>Ek Will Nie Kwaad Gaan Slaap Nie</li><li>Woorde</li><li>Will Jy Vry</li><li>Hoor Hoe Raas Die Stilte</li></ul><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Linda Mtoba biography: pregnancy, age, husband, wedding, and career</p><h2>Karlien van Jaarsveld marriage life</h2><p class=align-left>She has been married twice: to the rugby player Derick Hougard and then to Joe Breytenbach.</p><h3>Derick Hougaard</h3><p class=align-left>Her first marriage was to the rugby player Derick Hougaard. Derick and Karlien had a divorce back in 2015. In Huisegnoot, a family magazine, she gave the details of her very heartbreaking divorce. She recalled that in 2013 when Karlien van Jaarsveld wedding to Derrick happened. The divorce had not even crossed her mind. This is because she saw how difficult divorce could be after her parents had a divorce, and she then told herself that divorce would not be an option for her.</p><p class=align-left>She said, "It was after three years of non-stop pain. I thought the problems that Derrick and I had before our marriage would change or end."</p><p class=align-left>The problems only intensified, and she realized that she should have taken all the red flags more seriously. She had initially broken off their engagement, but seven months after that, they ended up getting married.</p><p class=align-left>She even gave her advice to everyone out there, saying," I realize now that if you have an inkling of doubt, you should not get married. The problems will only get worse."</p><p class=align-left>Despite this, they had beautiful children together, and that was the good that came out from her marriage.

However, Joe left for France, and their relationship did not advance past this point.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/c8144e5bd0683f7d.jpg><p class=align-left>They then reunited and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">got married in a secret ceremony</a>.
