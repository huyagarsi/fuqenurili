After<a href=#> TMZ reported</a> that a glass crack pipe was found in the Twilight star's West Hollywood condo, a source close to the actress exclusively tells Us Weekly that the report is false.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>TMZ obtained the sworn deposition of building manager <strong>Adrian Mayorga</strong>, who is suing Greene after claiming he "suffered permanent respiratory damage" from the incident. The site notes that several other tenants in the building are also suing the actress, following the fire that took one of her dog's lives.&nbsp;</p><p>The blaze occurred in March 2013, and TMZ notes that at the time Greene, 27, her brother, and her then-boyfriend <strong><a href=#>Ryan Phillippe</a></strong> were all supposedly sleeping inside the condo.&nbsp;</p><p>A source close to Greene bashed the manager's statement, telling Us, "There was no crack pipe found in Ashley's apartment. It's all hearsay from unnamed sources — Mayorga's claiming he heard from a friend of an unidentified worker who may have entered the apartment. Additionally, Phillippe went on the record saying he wasn't there."</p><p>In his deposition, Mayorga said that Staten Island Summer star and her guests looked "disoriented … they looked like they were drunk or under the influence of something." He also claimed that a man clearing up the wreckage after the fire found a glass crack pipe in Greene's apartment.&nbsp;</p><p>The source adds, "Of course Ashley was disoriented! She was awoken at 9 a.m. to her house being on fire. Who wouldn't be?"</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Despite his own sustained injuries, Mayorga wrote in his deposition that, "The only people I saw getting treated was Ashley Greene, her brother Joe Green, and the current boyfriend, Ryan Phillippe."&nbsp;</p><p><strong><a href=#>Reese Witherspoon</a></strong>'s ex submitted a sworn declaration saying that he was not in the apartment the night of the fire, nor had he ever been in her building.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaaq5ihsrp5xqucnqaVYq6xrdGtpJ6mpGKzqr7EZqWoZZehrrS%2FjJypmpubYr2qvMRmaWlpZGeDcnyO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
