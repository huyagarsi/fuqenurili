The Nittany Lions had a very different team, without Kerry Collins, Ki-Jana Carter and Kyle Brady on offense, but the buzz was still there for a very good team. Two years after joining the Big Ten, the Nittany Lions were finally set to face Wisconsin for the first time since 1970.</p><p>Wisconsin, making their first trip to Beaver Stadium, shutdown the defending Big Ten champions 19-7 in a meeting of he previous two Big Ten champions. The series since Penn State joined the Big Ten is tied 6-6, and Wisconsin owns an 8-6 advantage all-time with wins in 1953 and 1970.</p><p>There have been some interesting moments in the series, and Brett Bielema's&nbsp;exploitation&nbsp;of the kickoff rules in 2006 didn't sit well with Joe Paterno. Bielema and Wisconsin purposefully, and legally, sent the kickoff team before the kick so they would be offsides. The clock would run as soon as the kick was made, and time would not be placed back on the clock after an offsides call. Wisconsin effectively milked the clock and ensured Penn State could not touch the ball on offense.</p><p>Bielema used the rules to his advantage, but the entire sequence was deemed to be in poor sportsmanship.</p><p>Penn State responded with two blowout wins in the next two, and most recent, meetings. Penn State outscored Wisconsin by a combined 86-14.</p><p>Wisconsin is now Penn State's end-of-the-season rival in division play, replacing Michigan State. This sets up possible division championships to be on the line, which should add some extra fuel to the fire.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJobmloZW1%2FbrzEp6Vmq6SWwaZ5xaimrZqRoblufY9mq56Znah6tbTEZqWirKSWu7p5y6Kmp6tdoby3sYytpmaalZbBbrnOrKs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
