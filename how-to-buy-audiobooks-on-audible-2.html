By forcing you to go to the web, Amazon retains all of the money from each sale.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-i-buy-audible-books-on-my-iphone></span>How do I buy Audible books on my iPhone?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Follow these steps:</b><li class=TrT0Xe>Open the <b>Audible</b> app.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Tap Discover.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Search for and tap on the audiobook you want to add to your library.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Tap <b>Buy</b> with 1 Credit.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Tap Confirm.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>The audiobook is added to your library.</li><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-cant-i-buy-an-audible-book-on-amazon></span>Why can’t I buy an audible book on Amazon?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>If you have no remaining credits with your <b>Audible</b> membership, the option to <b>purchase</b> with a credit will be unavailable. You may instead <b>purchase</b> the audiobook using your 30% off member discount.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-audible-free-with-amazon-prime></span>Is audible free with Amazon Prime?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>An <b>Audible</b> membership does not come <b>free with Amazon Prime</b>, but while it requires a separate subscription, <b>Prime</b> members do stand to get discounted pricing on membership. A number of <b>Audible</b> books are <b>free</b> with your <b>Prime</b> membership, though the list of titles is small compared to the entire <b>Audible</b> library.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-audible-worth-the-money></span>Is audible worth the money?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Paying a monthly fee to get <b>Audible</b> membership is <b>worth it</b> if you listen to audio on the go and love reading. You can mark your place in an audiobook and make notes using the <b>Audible</b> app. However, this isn’t as efficient as having a copy of the book that you can flick through on a screen or a tablet.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-audible-worth-it-2020></span>Is audible worth it 2020?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>So, <b>Audible</b> is not <b>worth</b> it if: You’re a frugal person who cut on lattes to save for your retirement. Seriously, if that’s you, then the $14.95 monthly fee is definitely not something you would be excited about. You can buy books on <b>Audible</b> occasionally as a non-member, but a full-time membership is a strict no-no.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-audible-unlimited-worth-it></span>Is Audible Unlimited worth it?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>It’s actually the cheapest <b>unlimited</b> audiobook subscription on the market! However, the <b>Audible</b> Premium Plus plan is only $7 more expensive. So, yes, <b>Audible</b> Plus is <b>worth it</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-you-only-listen-to-1-book-a-month-on-audible></span>Can you only listen to 1 book a month on audible?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Yeah. The <b>subscription</b> plans give <b>you one</b> or two <b>books</b> per <b>month</b>, but <b>you can</b> always purchase more (and <b>you</b> get a discount <b>if you</b>‘re a member).<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=do-you-get-unlimited-books-with-audible></span>Do you get unlimited books with Audible?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>You get UNLIMITED</b> access to thousands of select audiobooks and podcasts in the <b>Audible</b> Plus Catalog for $7.95/month.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-the-most-expensive-book-on-audible></span>What is the most expensive book on Audible?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>With the price of $120.74, the <b>book</b> Ulysses, Authored by James Joyce and Narrated by Jim Norton is the <b>most expensive book on Audible</b>!<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=do-you-have-to-pay-for-each-book-on-audible></span>Do you have to pay for each book on Audible?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>You have to pay</b> for every <b>book you</b> want to listen to. It’s not a Netflix type system. Yes, there is a maximum amount of credits <b>you can have</b>, and it’s very low. Once <b>you</b> hit the cap <b>you</b> don’t <b>get</b> any more credits for your monthly fee.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-there-a-cheaper-alternative-to-audible></span>Is there a cheaper alternative to audible?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>audiobooksnow<p>Audiobooksnow can be assumed as the <b>cheapest Audible alternative</b>. Club pricing plan is the best deal on digital audiobooks you’ll find. Compared with the <b>Audible</b> subscription service fee–$14.99 per month, the Club pricing plan is $4.99.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=which-is-better-audible-or-audiobooks></span>Which is better audible or audiobooks?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Audible</b> and <b>Audiobooks</b>‘ key differences are that <b>Audible</b> offers a <b>better</b> returns policy and audio quality, more original titles, and a yearly subscription discount. Otherwise, the services are identical, the price, apps, and <b>audiobook</b> library are excellent for both.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-is-audible-so-expensive></span>Why is audible so expensive?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Because aside from the rights to do it, they have to pay for a narrator, producer, audio engineer and/or sound editor, packaging (yes, they still made the CDs even if you are downloading), advertising and etc. <b>Audible</b> just sells them mostly, another company is making them.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-the-average-cost-of-a-book-on-audible></span>What is the average cost of a book on Audible?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>If you listen to two <b>books</b> each month, <b>Audible</b> looks even more attractive. The <b>average book price</b> for the monthly platinum subscription is a few cents less than $11.50 and two full <b>price</b> audiobooks from the Google Play Store could easily <b>cost</b> four times as much.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-can-i-get-free-audible-credits></span>How can I get free audible credits?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>When you download the <b>Audible</b> app and sign up for the <b>free</b> trial, you <b>get</b> 2 <b>credits</b> added to your account for <b>free</b>. You’re only charged for the basic Gold Monthly membership after the 30-day trial. Once you are in a monthly <b>Audible</b> membership, you <b>get</b> 1 or 2 <b>free credits</b> every month, depending on which tier you choose.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=do-authors-make-money-from-audible></span>Do authors make money from Audible?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Audible</b> never pays <b>authors</b> the stated “royalty” rate. Instead, they base the “royalty” on “Net Sales,” a number so heavily manipulated by <b>Audible</b>, that these “Net Sales” adjustments amount to a 50% deduction from the retail selling price.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-can-i-turn-my-book-into-an-audiobook></span>How can I turn my book into an audiobook?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Here are the steps for how to make an <b>audiobook</b>:</b><li class=TrT0Xe>Prep <b>your book</b> for <b>audiobook</b> recording.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Decide who will record it.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Hire an <b>audiobook</b> narrator.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Record the <b>audiobook</b> yourself.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Work with an <b>audiobook</b> producer.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Create the <b>audiobook</b> at home.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Upload <b>your audiobook</b> to ACX.</li><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=do-audiobook-narrators-get-royalties></span>Do audiobook narrators get royalties?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Narrators get</b> paid in one of 3 ways: Pay for Production, <b>Royalty</b> Share, and <b>Royalty</b> Share Plus. The way it works is authors and <b>narrators</b> contact each other and negotiate a pay per finished hour (PFH).<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DAxJyfaKCfrHq1u46hprBlpKR6o8HYZpiunJmkr7C7yqxkqKZdlsKltcGlnGZqXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
