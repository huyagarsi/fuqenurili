Some other food options, which will be prepared by Chef Vinny Tacci and his staff of 95 people, include fresh sushi, pizza, wings, hot soup, made-to-order salads, and subs.

The 82,000-square-foot supermarket—which will be Wegmans’ second New York City store—will be located at 770 Broadway in Greenwich Village, which was formerly the Astor Place Kmart. As reported by Eater, the Manhattan store will have a seafood restaurant featuring both an oyster counter and sushi bar that will serve up an omakase experience.</p><p>While exact opening dates have not yet been revealed, other upcoming store locations include Norwalk, Conn.; Rockville, Md.; Lake Grove, N.Y.; Yardley, Pa.; and&nbsp;Holly Springs, N.C.—the regional Northeast-centered chain’s most southern outpost yet.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.eatthis.com/wp-content/themes/eatthis/img/etnt-logo.png alt="Eat this, not that" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Sign up for our newsletter!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82uq6uhpJ68r3vWnp6mmZ6oeqvB0q1kqKiVo7KlecitqmZpYWXBqXnSraarnV2eu26%2BxKyrqKZdq65w</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
