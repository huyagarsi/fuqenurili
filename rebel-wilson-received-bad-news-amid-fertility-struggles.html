I was also freezing my eggs because — as all good, career women out there should note — that if that’s something that interests you, it’s a pretty good time to do it. I was thinking about fertility and <a href=#>having good quality eggs in the bank</a>, so I was like, ‘OK, I’m going to do this. I’m going to get healthy.’”</p><p>The singer, who went to a “professional place to do a <a href=# data-link=1>detox</a>,” wrote that she had lost about 61 pounds.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“The goal was never to be skinny. It was never to fit into a certain dress size,” Wilson concluded at the time. “I put in a goal weight, [165 pounds], because I needed some tangible thing. … What I’m proud of myself is doing that and having a lot more balance now in my life.”</p><p>The comedian was dating businessman <strong>Jacob Busch</strong> at the time, but<a href=#> they split in February</a>. Wilson told Extra later that same month that she was<a href=#> in a “really good place”</a> following their breakup. “I feel like, I don’t know if it’s turning 40 or coming into your own,” she added. “Any kind of breakup is hard and not ideal.”</p><p>The Super Fun Night star explained to the outlet that the relationship had “run its course,” noting, “I am so busy with work, doing [my competitive dog grooming show] Pooch Perfect now, and I have three movies to shoot after this.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGarnZKauW7DyKWqqKZdp7KkscivnJ1lkpaxbrrEsKpmmZ2esW6yxKuroqSZqcZuv9OrrKCfnJrAcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
