On May 25th, 1944, Judy brought into the world in Chicago, Illinois. Chicago’s Siena High School was where she received her diploma. On May 4, 1963, she tied the knot with Jeffrey Anderson, the perfect man for her. Sixty years of their lives together were filled with incredible joy.</p><p>Jeffrey Anderson, Judy’s devoted husband, as well as her cherished children, Jeffrey Anderson (Brad Drew) and Jodi Anderson, are among those who are left behind after Judy’s passing. Both Izabelle Rose Legieza and Kendra Lynn Legieza were privileged to have her as their grandmother. Judy was a devoted sister to Lynn (Robert) Smith and an aunt to a large number of nieces and nephews, all of whom she cherished very much and loved with all of her heart.</p><p>Judy’s parents, Rose Brusa (Mesi) and Bennie Brusa, passed away before she took her own life. When Judy and Jeff moved to Naperville, Illinois in 1977, they had previously lived in Elmwood Park, Illinois. For the past 46 years, Judy has been employed in the commercial district of Naperville as a dental assistant. All of the patients who became her lifelong friends were the people she loved the most in her career. Her warm and welcoming personality, along with her dazzling smile, never failed to brighten any space she entered.</p><p>Otis, Judy’s rescue dog, was a great source of solace and support for her, and she enjoyed spending time with him while traveling. Doing anything and everything with her granddaughters was her favorite thing to do whenever she was free. Judy placed a high value on her family. Her role as the matriarch of the family was to bring everyone together and to ensure that every occasion was a memorable occasion. Everyone who she had the opportunity to influence during her lifetime will miss her tremendously.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiao5x7prDUZ62nZ5qqsarAx2ahrpypYq6vsMSrqqimXaSvqsDUmqmyZZyes6a4zqeeZqqVqLalsc2tZKieXaOusbHRr6ClpJVitq24yKemoqtdna60ec%2BaqqydlGKuuK3YZp2apZmhxm65zq6pp6tdmbKiwMdmq6GdXay8s7jDZqaboaSofA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
