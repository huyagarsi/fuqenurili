However, a new clip draws attention to another couple.
Jamie and Claire’s adoptive son, Fergus Fraser (César Domboy), married Marsali (Lauren Lyle) and things have been pretty great for the couple."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Did Fergus hurt you”</p><p>It comes as a great surprise to viewers that Fergus would do such a thing as he has never displayed any sort of violence like this toward Marsali in the past.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>However, Marsali’s next words confirm it for fans.</p><p>“He’s taken a notion that he should’ve been there to defend us,” Marsali replies.</p><p>A shot of Fergus is then shown as he apologizes for being “such a disappointment.”</p><p>He then walks away and the shot pans out to show Marsali looking away from him, indicating a possible separation for the pair.</p><p>So, what happened to cause such a rift?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=here-s-what-happened-in-season-5-of-outlander>Here’s what happened in Season 5 of Outlander</h2><p>For those that are wondering why Fergus is feeling he has let Marsali down, this likely has to do with Clare’s kidnapping in Season 5 of Outlander.</p><p>Lionel Brown (Ned Dennehey) kidnapped Claire and what ensued was a horrendous attack on Claire by his group. Claire was rescued but, obviously, she was traumatized by the event.</p><p>Later, Lionel turned up injured and, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">as TV Line points out</a>, Marsali had to attend to him because Claire was unable to deal with her abductor. During her care, Lionel then threatened Marsali.</p><p>Marsali responded by brewing some hemlock and injecting it into Lionel, which resulted in his death.</p><p>Likely, Fergus is talking about this entire situation and the lack of protection he probably felt because of what happened to both his wife and his adoptive mother. However, this certainly doesn’t condone his behavior towards his wife and this is shown at the end of the clip when Fergus leaves.</p><p>Of course, viewers will just have to wait until March in order to find out exactly how this storyline unfolds when Outlander returns for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 6</a>.</p><p>Season 6 of Outlander will premiere March 6, 2022 on Starz.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6trWinpam5orrDnqlmppWserSxwKymp2VmYrCttc9mn6KmpKh6osCMrJyroZ%2BqwG7A0aism6SVYq6pscCdZJ%2BnomKzpr7GrqpmmZ6Zeq6t0ayYpaFf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
