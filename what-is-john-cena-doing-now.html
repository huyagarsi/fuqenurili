He is a friend, a father figure, a mentor, a trusting resource, he’s filled with wisdom, but above all else, yes, I still think of him as my boss. I always like for them to give me ideas and then me to kind of make it my own”.</p><p>He's off on his own these days and while he’s not in the ring, he’s still making moves in other areas, like in his personal love life along with the recent release of a new animated series.</p><p>Let’s take a look at what the multi-time WWE Champion and future Hall Of Famer is up to these days.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=new-animated-series>New Animated Series</h2><p>From an animated YouTube series to signing a deal on the real tube with the Syfy channel, John Cena’s animated series Dallas and Robo is ready to make the leap forward to the new network. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cena tweeted out</a> the details most recently via social media;</p><p>“People of earth! #DallasAndRobo is hitting #TZGZ, @SYFY’s animated side, Saturday 8/8 at midnight-ish. Check out @tzgz_syfy to see the greatest space trucker tandem since Han and Chewy!”</p><p>A prime opportunity for the new show which is labeled as an adult comedy – it seems like John Cena is changing focus with this project, normally working animated shows and books for the younger generation.</p><p>He’ll be consumed by the show, for the time being, especially given that a lot of his film roles have been put on hold due to the current pandemic.</p><p>This begs the question; will it steer a John Cena return to the ring even further? Well, according to the recent word by the Wrestling Observer, the answer might be unfavorable to what most fans want to hear…</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED -&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nikki Bella Is Expecting A Baby With Her New Man, But John Cena’s Name Keeps Coming Up</a></span></p><h2 id=his-wwe-deal-might-ve-expired>His WWE Deal Might’ve Expired</h2><p>The news went viral, causing a storm on platforms like Twitter. According to Dave Meltzer of WON, Cena’s WWE deal quietly came to an end! Meaning, there’s even a minuscule chance he can return to the ring elsewhere… but yeah, don’t count on that taking place.</p><p>Cena issued a statement claiming he’s still very much part of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">WWE family,</a> though he’s focusing on other projects these days;</p><p>“WWE is still my heart. I’m still part of the family. I still keep in touch with a lot of folks. I try my best to teach and mentor when I can. But man, I’m 42,” said John Cena.</p><p>No doubt, Cena can still bring it in the ring or on the microphone, though he does make mention that his age is catching up. For the time being, a return full-time doesn’t seem to be in the works, though fans are hoping he makes a return, even if it is for a one-off.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Boss Vince McMahon has other plans at the moment, according to the latest reports, he’s desperately trying to create new stars – possibly finding his next John Cena. A lot easier said than done!</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED -&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">WWE Doesn’t Discuss These Backstage John Cena Stories</a></span></p><h2 id=he-might-be-engaged>He Might Be Engaged</h2><p>Relationship wise, John Cena decided to keep things quiet, unlike his ex Nikki Bella, who has been an open book pertaining to her personal life.</p><p>Cena keeps things on the DL, though according to Life and Style Mag, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">things are clicking </a>with his new partner Shay;</p><p>“Shay isn’t after his money,” the insider assured. “She’s not that kind of girl and loves him for who he is.” As for John, he finds the University of British Columbia graduate “beautiful, intelligent, kind, independent and family-orientated.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There is also a rumor floating around the two might’ve gotten engaged quietly behind the scenes – the media spotted a flashy rock on Shay’s hand out in public. Nonetheless, the couple chooses to keep things on the down-low, away from the public’s eye.</p><p>John is most certainly keeping busy despite the pandemic, he’s happily living the quarantine life alongside Shay, the BC, Canada native. Once things get back to normal, we’ll be seeing the WWE star in a few feature films, that for now remain on pause.</p><p>Here’s to hoping we see him back in a WWE ring as well, sooner rather than later.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT –<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Former WWE Superstar Claims That John Cena Stole Storylines And Ideas</a></span></p><p>Sources – Life & Style Mag, Republic World & Wrestling World</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0ecmon6dlk5q7onnDqKCnn12jvLh7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
