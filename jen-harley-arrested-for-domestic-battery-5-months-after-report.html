An insider revealed at the time that the duo were at the Hustler Club in Las Vegas when the altercation occurred.</p><p>Us&nbsp;obtained photos of the injured&nbsp;<a href=#>Jersey Shore: Family Vacation</a>&nbsp;star.

I can’t control her, I can’t control my daughter. Well, for right now I can, but not when she gets older.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The coparents appeared to be on better terms last month.

Harley planted a peck on Ortiz-Magro’s head at one point.</p><p>The reality star and Harley have experienced plenty of ups and downs since they began dating in 2017. The on-off couple got into a physical fight in June 2018 at a Las Vegas hotel. She was later arrested for domestic battery after she allegedly had an altercation with Ortiz-Magro in a car.&nbsp;Us&nbsp;confirmed that she would not face charges for the latter incident “due to insufficient evidence.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajnZ5itaK%2By56wZpmip7K0wMSdZJ%2BnomKxsLnErKuim12XrrXAxKuwZm1doryvwMesZJqepJq%2Fbr7EqaarrF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
