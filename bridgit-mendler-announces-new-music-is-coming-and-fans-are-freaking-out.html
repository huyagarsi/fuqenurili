You might know her for her song "Ready or Not," which remains her most iconic song to date. So when fans found out that Bridgit announced her musical comeback, they have the craziest, but excited reactions ever.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Disney Channel Stars Who Are Married</a></span></p><p>It has been nearly ten years since Bridgit has released her debut album&nbsp;Hello My Name Is.... So to see fans being exhilarated at the fact that she's returning is exciting. They have been waiting for so long and it will be interesting to see what Bridgit will bring in her new line of work.

As fans celebrate, they compared Bridgit coming back with new music as if the pandemic is ending or the Avatar from Avatar: The Last Airbender returning after so long. This year has turned for the better for her fans and now all they have to do is wait and listen in for new song teasers or possible music videos.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>2021 looks to be a promising year for someone like Bridgit.
