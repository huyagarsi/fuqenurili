Even though Sasha appears to have suddenly given up on all of the progress she has made, Cody refuses to accept it. He is determined to uncover the truth about what is really <a href=#>happening to his new friend.</a></p><h3>General Hospital Spoilers — Cody Smells a Rat</h3><p>Cody is going to put two and two together about Gladys Corbin (Bonnie Burroughs), Dr. Damon Montague (Darin Toonder), and their prior connection via Selina Wu (Lydia Look) – which only he and the other players in Selina’s games know about. He suspects that Gladys and Dr. Montague are working together to make sure Sasha never regains control of her life or finances. Cody’s refusal to accept the status quo will lead him down a path to uncover the truth about what is happening to Sasha, and Selina may not like it.</p><h3>GH Spoilers Spill Dr. Montague Raises a Red Flag</h3><p><a href=#>Cody may need all the help he can get</a> to uncover the truth about what is happening to Sasha. When he realizes Dr. Montague is Sasha’s court-appointed psychiatrist, everything will make sense. Finally, there is some logic behind Gladys’ shifty behavior and why he wants Sasha to steer clear of him! Still, exposing Gladys and Dr. Montague won’t be easy, because Cody will have to admit to how he knows them. Will Mac Scorpio (John J. York) help him as he acts as an informant to let the PCPD come down on Selina?</p><p><img alt="General Hospital Spoilers: Maxie Tips Off Cody to Sasha’s Recovery Struggles — Will He Talk Her Out of Going to Rehab?" width=1200 height=811 data-jpibfi-post-excerpt data-jpibfi-post-url=https://celebbabylaundry.com/2023/07/general-hospital-spoilers-maxie-tips-off-cody-to-sashas-recovery-struggles-will-he-talk-her-out-of-going-to-rehab/ data-jpibfi-post-title="General Hospital Spoilers: Maxie Tips Off Cody to Sasha’s Recovery Struggles — Will He Talk Her Out of Going to Rehab?" data-jpibfi-src sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebbabylaundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/GH-JOsh-Kelly-22-1.jpg></p><h3>General Hospital Spoilers — Rehab Awaits</h3><p>Sasha’s behavior may nearly <a href=# rel=nofollow>lead her back to rehab,</a> but this time, Cody could come to her aid in the nick of time. Sasha is spiraling out of control, and she needs help, but that doesn’t mean she needs the professional kind. Compassion and a true friend can go a long way. Cody is not going to give up on her, even when she is convinced she has lost her mind. Will he turn on Selina and the gang and give up his access to her high stakes poker games for a shot at being a real friend to Sasha? <a href=#>Stay tuned for more GH news and spoilers to find out.</a></p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo67Am7ClmaWjsbPFjZympmdiZX90e49wZqCdnpq%2ForiMoaasqJmprq150qmmoqSVp8BuucCxoJ5lpJ69tHnOn51mm5%2BZxm7AzmaqmquYlsBuvsScpq%2Bdoq56tMDRrp6gpJWoeri1y6VkoZ1dqa6tt4yhnKtln6rBbrvFZp6ooZ6cerW7jKucoZmSZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
