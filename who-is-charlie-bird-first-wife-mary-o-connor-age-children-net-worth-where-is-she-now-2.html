He also worked on a few writing projects.</p><p>On 27 October 2021, Charlie disclosed that he got diagnosed with Motor Neuron Disease. It is an uncommon condition with no cure that affects the brain and nerves.

Furthermore, she was the one to inspire her ex-husband to pursue broadcast journalism. Regardless, the two left each other, which came to be after Charlie’s long-time affair with Carole Coleman (present wife since May 2016).</p><p>Mary’s children are all adults, to say, she is a grandma now. Whatsmore, she and her husband seem to have mutual responsibilities towards their children.</p><p>Even though their marriage met an unfortunate end in 1998 after 24 years together, Charlie says that the two are&nbsp;good friends. Reports suggest that they meet on family occasions and birthdays. A festival like Christmas is also an occasion when they share a few drinks.</p><p>Charlie’s 2006&nbsp;book, This Is Charlie Bird, talked about their marriage and its end.</p><p>Besides a little about Mary’s married life, Mary never revealed much including, her parents, educational qualifications, and professional background.</p><p>Regarding her age, it is probably between 65 to 75 years, while her ex-husband is 72.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=mary-o-connor-net-worth></span>Mary O Connor Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The estimated net worth of Mary O Connor, who is relatively shy of the spotlight, remains a mystery.</p><p>However, we know about her ex-husband.

Probably, most of what he earned is from his salary as a journalist.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=where-is-mary-o-connor-now></span>Where Is Mary O Connor Now?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>About Mary O Connor’s whereabouts, it remains hidden.</p><p>After the end of her 24-year-long marriage, she never took the spotlight. We never heard much from her and Charlie. But, reports say that they are good friends and even meet occasionally.</p><p>With that, it won’t be a stretch to say that Mary lives somewhat near her family.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHqqv4ycn5qqnJ6ybq7Iq5tmnpmnwLV51qKdnmWdlr%2B6ec5mmqimnqS%2Fbq3GnmScoJmhsbOxzWalnqxdrLyzwMdmrqGdopp6qr%2BMrJ%2BeZZ6kxG5%2Bjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
