Lo and behold, they were dynamic with one another during their time on the miniseries.</p><p>Paul Rudd had a lot to say about working with Will Ferrell on The Shrink Next Door, and we have all the details below.</p><h2 id=paul-rudd-and-will-ferrell-have-done-great-work-together>Paul Rudd And Will Ferrell Have Done Great Work Together</h2><p>Some comedic duos just seem destined to work together, and the pairing of Paul Rudd and Will Ferrell is a perfect example of this. They are quite different in their delivery, but when working together, they are dynamic in a way that few duos are.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite being fantastic with one another on screen, Ferrell and Rudd have not done many projects together. They have collaborated with many similar performers, but their paths have not crossed often on the big or small screen.</p><p>As many fans know, both were key elements of the Anchorman movies. Their interactions in both films were hilarious, and people wanted to see more of them working together after the Anchorman flicks came and went.</p><p>Thankfully, fans got their wish just last year, when Ferrell and Rudd partnered together for The Shrink Next Door.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Will Ferrell Based His Hilarious 'Eastbound & Down' Character On An Iconic Sports Entertainer</a></span></p><h2 id=rudd-and-ferrell-appeared-on-39-the-shrink-next-door-39>Rudd And Ferrell Appeared On 'The Shrink Next Door'</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In November 2021, The Shrink Next Door made its debut on Apple TV, and fans could hardly contain their excitement. Rudd and Ferrell were teaming up once again, but this time around, the style of comedy was going to be much different.</p><p>The series was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a dark comedy with a unique backstory</a>, and this was something that Ferrell dished on when speaking with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hollywood Reporter</a>.</p><p>"I think you’re laughing through the tears of what’s going on. You feel so bad for Marty at times, and some of the situations are so absurd that you can’t help but laugh. At the same time, it’s a very vulnerable place that this character goes to. And even Ike, who’s the “bad guy” in it, you see the human side of him as well," the actor said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now, many comedic actors like to improv to get the funniest take possible, but they don't always have the chance to do this while working on certain projects. While there was some improv between the two actors, they largely stuck to the script at hand.</p><p>"It was a dense script and we certainly adhered to it, but there were moments when we’d kind of veer off of it a bit. And Will said something interesting, he said, “Isn’t it interesting how when you’re improvising as one character, like if we were improvising in Anchorman, it felt totally different than improvising in this?” You do think differently as a different character," said Rudd.</p><p>The miniseries believed that it had the right recipe with Rudd and Ferrell largely sticking to the script, and many fans enjoyed their chemistry on-screen. This, of course, had people curious about their working relationship.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Will Ferrell Won't Ever Work Another Film With This Iconic Comedic Actor</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-rudd-has-said-about-ferrell>What Rudd Has Said About Ferrell</h2><p>So, what was it like for Paul Rudd to work with Will Ferrell on The Shrink Next Door? Well, based on Rudd's words, he has a lot of respect for Ferrell and what he brings to the table as an actor.</p><p>Rudd acknowledged the amazing job that Ferrell did with this character, who was a stark contrast to Anchorman's Ron Burgundy.</p><p>According to Rudd, "It’s really a testament to Will as an actor, truly because I know that I’m biased, but I think Ron Burgundy is one of the greatest comic personas and performers of the past half-century. Maybe even the full century, right?"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"And for him to be that consistently funny and then to see him in this show and he’s playing somebody who’s very un-Ron Burgundy and broken in different ways but also a sympathetic character and a very human character who’s complex and nuanced … and it’s a home run," he added.</p><p>That is some seriously high praise, and it's quite clear that Rudd loves working with Ferrell and views him as an exceptional talent.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Paul Rudd's Biggest Achievements Before Becoming People's 'Sexiest Man Alive'</a></span></p><p>Paul Rudd and Will Ferrell are both talented performers, and hopefully, fans will get to see the duo work together on another project down the line.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>The Truth About Jennifer Aniston And Paul Rudd’s Relationship</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGinmq2cYr%2B2sMNmrqKknGKzpr7RnqOlZaSdsm6%2Fx6ugp6Ndo7K5wIydpqiqXZu%2FqrHNnaqhoaBk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
