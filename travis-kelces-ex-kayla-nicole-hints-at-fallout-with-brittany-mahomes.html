“Friendship breakups are tough. But it’s a part [sic] of life,” Nicole, 32, wrote during an Instagram Story Q&A on Wednesday, November 29. “People are sometimes only meant to be in your life for a season.”
She continued: “Give yourself time and permission to grieve — because losing that bond can be heartbreaking."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

But it’s a part [sic] of life,” Nicole, 32, wrote during an Instagram Story Q&A on Wednesday, November 29. “People are sometimes only meant to be in your life for a season.”</p><p>She continued: “Give yourself time and permission to grieve — because losing that bond can be heartbreaking. But also, acknowledge the bounty and beauty of friendships that you still have. Shift your focus from what you’ve lost to what you have maintained, and even more exciting — the new friendships you will forge in time.”</p><p>Last month, Nicole explained her decision to <a href=#>“publicly unfollow”</a> Brittany and Patrick, both 28, after years of being close friends with the couple. “The reality is I know these people in real life,” she told <a href=# rel=noopener>People</a> on October 25. “And so, in real life, I’ve communicated to these people why I’ve had to publicly make the decisions that I made.”</p><p>Nicole, who <a href=#>dated Kelce</a>, 34, on and off from 2017 to 2022, hit the <a href=#>unfollow button</a> not long after Brittany became friends with Kelce’s new girlfriend, <strong>Taylor Swift</strong>. Swift, 33, has been <a href=#>romantically connected</a> to the Kansas City Chiefs tight end since September.</p><p>Earlier this month, Swift hosted an NFL viewing party attended by Brittany and fellow Chiefs spouses <strong>Paige Buechele</strong> (wife of the team’s former backup QB <strong>Shane Buechele</strong>) and <strong>Lyndsay Bell</strong> (wife of tight end <strong>Blake Bell</strong>) on November 5.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Travis-Kelces-Ex-Kayla-Nicole-Addresses-Friendship-Breakups-After-Unfollowing-Brittany-Mahomes-2.jpg><p>“Taylor is loving her newfound friendships with the other wives and girlfriends of Travis’ teammates,” a source exclusively told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> days later. “She appreciates that they know how to have fun just like she does and she loves cheering Travis and the Chiefs on alongside all of them.”</p><p>As Swift and Kelce’s romance continues to make headlines, Nicole has been candid about how her and the athlete’s split <a href=#>affected her mental health</a>. “I felt like s— and I was sad, and I was having a hard time getting out of bed,” she recalled in an interview with <a href=# rel=noopener>People</a> last month. “It got to the point where I was like, ‘OK, what else can I possibly do?’ So, I started going to therapy.”</p><p>Though she didn’t directly mention Kelce and Swift’s relationship, Nicole noted that therapy has helped her deal with her ex’s <a href=#>newfound popularity</a>. “Had I not done that, I don’t know how I would be reacting in the moment right now. No clue,” she added.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Travis-Kelces-Ex-Kayla-Nicole-Addresses-Friendship-Breakups-After-Unfollowing-Brittany-Mahomes.jpg><p>She also wishes she could tell her past self to “buckle the f—k up” for the publicity surrounding Kelce’s love life. “You thought the worst had already come, but buckle up and take all of the tools right now and put them in your bag because you’re going to need them,” she stated.</p><p>Now, Nicole seemingly <a href=#>has a new crush</a> on Philadelphia Eagles QB (and teammate of Travis’ brother, <strong>Jason Kelce</strong>) <strong>Jalen Hurts</strong>. “Fly eagles fly,” she wrote via <a href=# rel=noopener>X</a> (formerly Twitter) alongside a reposted video of Hurts, 25, at an NBA game on Monday, November 27. After fans teased her flirty post in the comments, she jokingly <a href=# rel=noopener>replied</a>, “Y’all have eyes too 😂.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatqpGrtrR5yp6jnJ2jYrK5ecqasKWZXaO2pLvLnmShoZ6pwG6t02admqScpMK1edaiq6Flkqe2tcDAp7BmpZGdvK6x0mg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
