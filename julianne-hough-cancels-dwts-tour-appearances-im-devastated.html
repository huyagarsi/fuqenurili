(She has not revealed what production altered its filming schedule.)</p><p class=p3>The <a href=#><i>DWTS 2024 </i>live show</a> began in Richmond, Virginia, on January 11, hosted by pro <strong>Emma Slater</strong>. The show’s roster of participants includes <strong>Alan Bersten</strong>, <strong>Alexis Warr</strong>, <strong>Artem Chigvinstev</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Brandon Armstrong</strong>, <strong>Britt Stewart</strong>, <strong>Daniella Karagach</strong>, <strong>Ezra Sosa</strong>, <strong>Gleb Savchenko</strong>, <strong>Rylee Arnold</strong> and <strong>Pasha Pashkov</strong>.

It feels like it’s just gonna be, like, a peek into our friendship and our lives,” Hough <a href=#>gushed to </a><i><a href=#>Variety</a> </i>in August 2023. “With this season specifically, we are all so close. We’ve been friends for over 10 years.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p3>She continued at the time, “It feels kind of nostalgic, like, the band is back together. It feels like we’re in the older seasons of <i>Dancing With the Stars</i>, with the wisdom and the knowledge of all the years of experience, but with the sense of nostalgia and home from the earlier seasons.”</p><p class=p3>Hough replaced <strong>Tyra Banks</strong> as host, who approved of the casting switch.</p><p class=p3>“The businesswoman in me sees how Julianne is great on multiple levels. She’s a professional dancer. She is the sister of Derek [Hough], a <i>DWTS</i> multi-champion, who is now a stellar judge,” Banks, 50<a href=#> exclusively told <i>Us Weekly </i></a>in March 2023. “It’s going to be a family affair in that ballroom which people will love to watch. And she has so much personality and strong opinions backed by expertise. She’s a perfect choice! She’s gonna crush it!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajrZyerq%2B6xGafqK2XnXqkrc2cnKWrXZnEtb%2BMraauql2WvbGxwKuYp5uVqHqquYydnK%2BZo6mutbHDaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
