For glam, the blonde beauty wore minimal makeup and had her sunny tresses tucked underneath the hood of the garb.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>While the nature of the shoot is not immediately clear, it’s safe to say Bündchen is doing what she does best.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>From 2002 to 2017, the fashion star was hailed as the highest-paid model in the world. She officially retired from modeling in 2015, strolling down the runway one final time during São Paulo Fashion Week. (Her career highlights include modeling for Alexander McQueen, Christian Dior, Chanel, Prada and more.)&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“I am grateful that at 14, I was given the opportunity to start this journey,” the style icon wrote via Instagram after her final gig. “Today, after 20 years in the industry, it is a privilege to be doing my last fashion show by choice and yet still be working in other facets of the business.” (Bündchen continued to appear in campaigns and ads —&nbsp;but on a much smaller scale.)&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/gisele-bundchen-turns-up-the-heat-models-sexy-swimsuit-pics-01.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1>At the time, Bündchen credited her decision to her desire to spend more time with then-husband <a href=#><strong>Tom Brady</strong></a>, who was playing for the New England Patriots, and their two children, Benjamin, 13, and Vivian, 10. Brady, 45, also shares son John, 15, with ex <a href=#><strong>Bridget Moynahan</strong></a>.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The pair made headlines in October 2022 when they <a href=#>announced their divorce</a> after more than 13 years of marriage.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“In recent days, my wife and I finalized our divorce from one another after 13 years of marriage,” the quarterback wrote via Instagram at the time. “We arrived at this decision amicably and with gratitude for the time we spent together.

We will continue to work together as parents to always ensure they receive the love and attention they deserve.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Bündchen posted a similar statement, sharing that she feels “blessed for the time we had together.”</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Friday’s glam moment isn’t the first time Bündchen turned heads following her divorce.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>In December 2022, the supermodel attended jewelry brand Vivara’s <a href=#>60th anniversary celebration</a> in her native Brazil. For the glitzy occasion, Bündchen was a shimmery sight in a gold halter gown. The stunning number featured crisscross straps and an opening at the bodice. The dress was finished with a long skirt.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5y2tLHLnmSbrZ6ZsKmxzWarrqqeqHq2vIytn55lmJqutXnMqJuepKNiwKbE2GaqsKGdqMKqwIypoJyrXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
