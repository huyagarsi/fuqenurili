The birthday girl is <a href=#>growing up “way too fast,”</a> Aniston wrote via Instagram in November 2019 after Cox snapped a Thanksgiving selfie with her daughter. “Or am I protecting?” the Morning Show star asked. “Love you deep.”</p><p>The mother-daughter shot came six months after Arquette, 49, exclusively told Us Weekly about his “brilliant” kid’s “huge heart.” The actor gushed at the time: “I was a really wild child, so she’s a lot cooler than I was, a lot more confident than I’d ever been. I think when you have trust and you can be open with them, that helps. Just showing them love, being supportive.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Jennifer-Aniston-Celebrates-Courteney-Cox-Daughter-Coco-17th-Birthday-1.jpg><p>The Virginia native, who is also the father of Charlie, 7, and Augustus, 4, with <a href=#><strong>Christina McLarty</strong></a>, called<a href=#> coparenting with Cox</a> his “No. 1 priority.” He added, “We have respect and love for each other and just [are] on the same page. And [with] Coco, we’re just super lucky, as far as teenagers go.”</p><p>Coco’s parents split in 2010, and the former couple have <a href=#>a “friendship and relationship that is [made] out of respect,”</a> Arquette told Yahoo! Entertainment in August 2020. “We never went head-to-head, [or] battled each other, through the process of divorce and through the process of raising our kid.”</p><p>Arquette went on to tell The Guardian in January that <a href=#>he owes the teenager an apology</a>. “Divorce is so difficult,” the See Spot Run star explained at the time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGajnZ6jtqex0WaYp6GjqbyvecKeo56aopbBpr%2BMnKauqqSau6bFjJymsatdma62s8etnKurXWaEtbSMm6CrrJiZrrp7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
