Not only failure, but you feel like, ‘I’m to blame for it. <a href=#>It was me that screwed up</a>.’ And you can’t point the finger at anyone else. So yeah, I was disappointed in it. It’s always easy to be smart in hindsight. The thing was how do you make the best of that situation?”</p><p class=p1>He continued: “[Going to couple’s therapy] <a href=#>was the biggest mistake I’ve ever made</a>. That guy was so full of s—t. He said more crap and more nonsense. It was absolutely counterproductive to our future relationship. … Maria talked me into it. I went, and I felt instinctively maybe I shouldn’t go because I know I screwed up. I don’t have to go through anyone to have to explain to me anything. I apologized to Maria. I apologized to the kids.”</p><p class=p1>Following their split, the Austria native has continued to <a href=#>praise his former spouse as a coparent</a> as they jointly raised children <a href=#><strong>Katherine Schwarzenegger</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Christina Schwarzenegger</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Patrick Schwarzenegger</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Christopher Schwarzenegger</strong></a>.</p><p class=p1>“Luckily, Maria has been a terrific mother,” the&nbsp;<i>Jingle All the Way&nbsp;</i>star previously told&nbsp;<i>Extra</i>&nbsp;in 2012. “We work together even though we’re going through a divorce. … We make sure that the kids grow up to be really good human beings.”</p><p class=p1><i>Us Weekly&nbsp;</i>confirmed in December 2021 that<a href=#> the pair’s divorce paperwork was finalized after 10 years</a>.</p><p class=p1>“I grew up in a very strict Catholic household, and I was raised with a judgmental God, and I don’t believe in that anymore,” Shriver previously told&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Access Hollywood</a>&nbsp;</i>in March 2018 about <a href=#>how her divorce shifted her perspective</a>. “I believe all religion is based in love, and the less judgmental we are across our life, the better we are.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>The now-exes eventually <a href=#>reached a settlement in their divorce in June 2022</a> when Shriver was awarded half of the actor’s retirement accounts per a court filing at the time.</p><p class=p1>Scroll below to revisit Arnold and the Women’s Alzheimer’s Movement founder’s complete relationship timeline:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkrrO6zqWbZquTncSivtmepZ6fl5q%2FbrnAq6CaZaOdv6rCxKuqZqqVoa61tc6nqqGhoGLBqrnEpaCnnV8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
