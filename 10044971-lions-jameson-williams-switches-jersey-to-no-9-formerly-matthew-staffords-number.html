He won a Super Bowl in his first year with his new team.</p><p>Though Detroit has not yet retired the quarterback's number, Stafford is the franchise's <a href=# rel=noopener>all-time leader</a> in passing yards, passing touchdowns and wins as a starting quarterback.</p><p>Williams, meanwhile, originally planned to wear No. 18 after his first choice of No. 1 was already taken by Jeff Okudah.</p><p>"One reason was Calvin Johnson had 81 and seeing 81, I wanted to flip it," Williams <a href=# rel=noopener>told reporters</a> in May. "Then Randy Moss had 18 one time. He was my favorite receiver, so 18."</p><p>The rookie will instead go with the single-digit number as he tries to make his mark in the NFL.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGloZGmGeH2MpaCopqNit6K5xKymp2WnnrmttcCmqmarp57BpLTErGSjnaKosrp506hkp6ddbnqnu9GmnKukqWK6osDToZywZaOprqeyzqubrGWeqrqjsdE%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
