While both actors are well-liked by their fans, Ben Stiller is more popular if you ask me.

(@xwokeuplikedis) <a href=# rel=noopener>July 3, 2020</a></figure><p>Read more below about why Ben’s more popular than Adam amongst fans.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Sandler vs. Stiller</h2><p>If one thing’s for sure, it’s that fans sometimes can’t even distinguish who’s who between Sandler and Stiller, but they know their stuff if you ask them about who’s better out of the two.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Who’s Funnier?</h3><p>Despite how both actors are identifiable as comedians in their own right, it only makes sense for one to be funnier than the other, doesn’t it? Because we can’t all be as hysterically funny as the last comedian, can we?&nbsp;</p><p>In an <a href=# rel=noopener>interview</a> with ABC, Adam revealed, “When you do a comedy, there is an expectation that when people watch the comedy that they’re going to laugh, they expect to laugh. And when you’re doing a drama, you don’t have that pressure.”</p><p>But does this make him the funniest?&nbsp;</p><p>Well, in the case of Sandler v Stiller, the odds weigh in Stiller’s favor. The votes are in, and the jury has come to their verdict, with fans declaring that Stiller is the funnier guy out of the pair.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Ben Stiller is funnier then Adam Sandler and that's a fact</p>— Wyl (@AspiringKidActr) <a href=# rel=noopener>July 8, 2020</a></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Who’s Richer?</h3><p>Adam is richer than Ben, with his net worth standing at a staggering $400 million while Ben’s is half that, standing at $200 million.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Who’s Most Famous?</h3><p>According to YouGov, <a href=# rel=noopener>97%</a> of participants have heard of Sandler, whereas <a href=# rel=noopener>94%</a> of participants have heard of Stiller. Something that could be of particular interest is that Sandler is ranked as the eighth most famous compared with Stiller, who’s the 38th most famous actor. And you might think that this makes Sandler more popular, but let me explain why he’s not.&nbsp;</p><p>YouGov revealed that 14% of those surveyed have a negative opinion of Sandler compared with 9% who hold negative opinions on Stiller. The people have spoken, and although Sandler is technically more famous or well-known in comparison to fellow actor Stiller, people are more prone to holding negative views on Sandler compared to Stiller; therefore, Stiller is more likable.&nbsp;</p><p>A similarity between the two is that they’re both more liked by women. 51% of women compared with 49% of men hold complimentary views about Stiller, while 53% of women and 47% of men have positive views about Sandler.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Hilarious and Talented</h2><p>As someone who’s exposed to the public eye on almost a daily basis, it only makes sense for your fans to form opinions on you, and that’s exactly what they have done in the case of Adam v Ben.&nbsp;</p><p>A notable similarity between how the two are described by fans is that they’re both “hilarious” and “talented,” with Ben being <a href=# rel=noopener>described as</a>, “Entertaining, Talented, Hilarious, Authentic and Intelligent” compared to Adam, who’s <a href=# rel=noopener>described as</a>, “Entertaining, Hilarious, Talented, Natural Performer and Likeable.”&nbsp;</p><p>As aforementioned, Stiller stars in movies that are inherently better than Sandler’s movies. Fans describe Sandler’s films as “<a href=# rel=noopener>hit and miss</a>,” but they do recognize that he’s still a half-decent actor (and technically he’s more ‘successful’), so it’s not all bad.<br>Of Stiller, however, <a href=# rel=noopener>fans say</a>, “Ben Stiller can make things funny with facial expressions and situation comedy.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo63NrK6eqqNjsLC5jpqbmqVdqK6vsMueqWauo2KvprqMrKuipJyav27Dx6iqZqWfp7JuvM6prKWZomQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
