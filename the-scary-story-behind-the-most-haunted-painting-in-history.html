As reported by Vintage News Daily, the sellers claimed that the painting was cursed. According to Dummies, the sellers' children claimed that the figures in the painting were fighting with each other and would move at night, sometimes coming into their room. The Daily Dot adds that in order to put his daughter's mind to rest, the man placed a motion-triggered camera in the room, thinking he'd prove that haunted paintings don't exist."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Instead, he claimed to have captured footage of the young boy attempting to escape the painting. The sellers added that anyone seeking to purchase the painting would have to sign a disclaimer releasing them from all liability.</p><p>The whole thing went viral. The eBay listing was visited 30,000 times, and many people claimed that simply viewing the painting on their computer screens made them physically ill, caused them to blackout and lose time, or hear creepy voices. The price ballooned from $199 to $1,025. The winning bid was a gallery owner, and the painting remains in storage in Grand Rapids, Michigan.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCAlXFrcWlfqbWmedKcmKuxXajBsL7YZpmeoJmjsW7Ax55kpqejqXqprdSnq56cXaWuqrrToqWgZZmjeqm10q2mq7Ff</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
