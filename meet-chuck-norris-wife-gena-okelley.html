She is an American businesswoman, actress, and former model.</p><h2><strong>Gena O’Kelley is an American from California</strong></h2><p>Gena O’Kelley is a native of California.

She was born on the 10th of August 1963. She is evidently much younger than her famous husband, who was born on the 10th of March, 1940, and so is 83 years old.</p><p>The pair have a 23-year age difference between them, meaning that Gena O’Kelley was born two years before her future husband, Chuck, joined the United States Air Force as an Air Policeman (AP).</p><p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/byliner.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Gena-O-Kelley-1.jpg alt="Gena O'Kelley" width=800 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>image source</a></p><h2><strong>Chuck Norris Met Gena O’Kelley in 1997</strong></h2><p>Chuck Norris met Gena O’Kelley through weird circumstances in 1997. As the story goes, the duo met while Chuck was on a date with another woman. He, however, picked interest in Gena and so sent his assistant to set up a meeting between them. The pair later developed a friendship that evolved into a loving relationship and marriage.</p><h3><strong>She Became Chuck Norris’ Wife in 1998 and they Have Two Children Together</strong></h3><p>After dating for about a year, Chuck and Gena tied the knot on the 28th of November 1998. About three years after their nuptials, they welcomed their first kids together – a pair of twins named Dakota Alan Norris and Danilee Kelly Norris, who were born on August 30, 2001.</p><p>Just like their father, who is an actor and has a black belt in Tang Soo Do, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, and judo, the duo have taken an interest in martial arts. Dakota is a 3rd-degree black belt holder and has a YouTube channel where he shows off his talents.</p><h3><strong>Both Gena and Chuck Have Children From Past Relationships</strong></h3><p>Both Gena O’Kelley and her husband were married and divorced before their paths crossed. Gena’s first marriage was to a man named Gordon Hinschberger and their union produced two children, Kelley Gene Tagudin and Timothy Robert Hinschberger, before they got divorced.</p><p>Kelley Gene Tagudin came into the world on September 11, 1985, when her mother was just 22 years old. She is now reported to be a 3rd-grade teacher residing in Navasota, Texas, where she’s built a loving family of her own. Gena’s other child, Timothy Robert, was born on May 3, 1987. Much about him is unknown, but he is now reportedly happily married. He shares a passion for dogs and finds joy in sports, making him both an animal enthusiast and a sports aficionado.</p><p>On Chuck Norris’s part, he was married to Dianne Holechek and had two sons with her. Their first son, Michael Ray “Mike” Norris, was born on October 4, 1962, while their second son, Eric Scott Norris, was born on May 20, 1965. Mike Norris is an actor and producer just like his father, while Eric is a former stock car racing driver and stuntman. Chuck’s third child, Dina DeCioli, came from an extramarital affair he had with a woman named Joanna.</p><h3><strong>What Happened To Chuck Norris’ First Wife</strong></h3><p>Chuck Norris’ first wife, Dianne Holechek, is still alive and well. The teenage lovers married in 1958 when Chuck was 18 years old and Dianne was 17 years. Their marriage lasted for 30 years, and they divorced in 1989.</p><p>Dianne has kept a low profile since her divorce from Chuck. In 2017, she spoke out about her divorce in an interview with People magazine, saying that it was a difficult time for her, but that she has since moved on with her life. She said that she is grateful for the years she spent with Chuck and that they remain friends.</p><p>Diane lives in California and is involved in charitable work. She is a private person and does not share much about her personal life on social media. However, Diane occasionally posts photos of her charitable work and seven grandchildren.</p><h2><strong>What Does Chuck Norris’ Wife, Gena O’Kelley, Do FOr A Living?</strong></h2><p>Gena O’Kelley is said to have started modeling straight out of high school. She, however, did not do much work in the field as she has done as an actress. Chuck Norris’s wife has featured in projects like Yes Dear (2006), Praise the Lord (2009), and Hannity (2012).</p><p>On the business side of things, Gena appears to be excelling. In conjunction with her husband, she has made investments in various businesses and real estate. They reportedly own Kickstart Kids, an organization that provides martial arts instruction to children and adolescents, while Gena is the founder and CEO of a bottled water company in Navasota, Texas, known as CForce.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/byliner.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Gena-O-Kelley-1.jpg><h3><strong>Chuck Norris’s Wife Suffers From Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis (NSF)</strong></h3><p>In 2013, Gena O’Kelley was diagnosed with a rare condition called nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF), a condition that can cause scarring of the skin, bones, and internal organs. It is caused by a contrast agent that is used in MRI scans.</p><p>Gena had gone for an MRI for rheumatoid arthritis, where the chemical element gadolinium was injected into her to help with clearer scan results. However, she began to experience burning pain that eventually resulted in burning nerve pain and kidney problems.</p><p>Gena has since been undergoing treatment for NSF, and it has had a significant impact on her health. She has had to have several surgeries and has been in and out of the hospital. She has also had to deal with the emotional and physical challenges of the condition.</p><p>Chuck has been very supportive of Gena during her illness. He has put his career on hold to care for her. He has also spoken out about the dangers of the contrast agent that caused her condition and they have since sued numerous medical companies for over $10 million in damages for poisoning.</p><h3><b>FAQs</b></h3><h3><strong>How Tall is Chuck Norris’ Wife?</strong></h3><p>Gena O’Kelley is 5 feet 8 inches tall.
