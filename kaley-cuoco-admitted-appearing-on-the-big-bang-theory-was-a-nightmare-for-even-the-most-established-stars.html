However, it was a different story for those that weren't used to it, especially for well-known film stars.</p><p>Cuoco revealed, "Obviously, my whole life is a sitcom," Kaley said. "Especially with Big Bang, ‘cos the cast was like (go go go go go), there was no gap."</p><p>"We’d have these guest stars come on, and some of them were wonderful dramatic actors or whatever, and they would feel so lost for a while.

We thought, what if Billy is this socially awkward, sympathetic doctor who doesn’t quite know how to process Penny’s flirtations with him. We had that basic idea and went to Billy and his people ran it by them. Billy was on the phone, and he thought it was a really fun idea and was into it.
