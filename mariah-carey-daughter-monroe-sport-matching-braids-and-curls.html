The eye-catching look featured cornrows and big bouncy curls. The pair also sported metallic hair clips. “Roe Roe Diva! … And Mimi!!” the New York native wrote alongside the <a href=#>Instagram shot</a>.</p><p>Carey and her daughter continued their coordination with their outfits. The duo complemented each other in black tops. The Grammy winner paired hers with a tulle skirt and belt while Monroe opted for a blue sequin miniskirt that was finished with a mesh hem. The pre-teen also wore a glossy leather jacket, black knee-high socks and Converse sneakers. Carey, meanwhile, donned a pair of sparkly sandal heels. She also wore gold hoop earrings.</p><p>The “All I Want for Christmas Is You” artist had <a href=#>another matching moment</a> with Monroe in September. Carey shared a sweet photo of the two rocking sweatsuits that celebrated the 25th anniversary of her Butterfly album.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Mariah-Carey-and-Her-Daughter-Rock-Matching-Braided-Hairstyles-001.jpg><p>The songstress shares Monroe and her twin brother, Moroccan, with ex-husband <a href=#><strong>Nick Cannon</strong></a>.</p><p>Cannon, 41, recently welcomed <a href=#>his first child with <strong>LaNisha Cole</strong></a> — a daughter named Onyx — weeks before <a href=#><strong>Brittany Bell</strong> gave birth</a> to the pair’s third child together.</p><p>“Another Blessing!!! As my journey on this planet becomes more and more remarkable and unfathomable, all I can do is thank God and continue to ask the Most High to order my steps,” the actor captioned a September 30 Instagram post. “He has given me stewardship and dominion over a family dynamic that to some is unimaginable. But more importantly he has blessed me with loving individuals to guide me with care through this purposeful life. I am so indebted and grateful for the matriarch energy in my time of need.”</p><p>The Wild ’N Out cohost shares son Golden, 5, and daughter Powerful Queen, 19 months, with Bell, 34, twins Zion and Zillion, 15 months, with pregnant <strong>Abby De La Rosa</strong> and son Legendary, 2 months, with <strong>Bre Tiesi</strong>. Cannon’s 5-month-old son Zen, whom he shared with <strong>Alyssa Scott</strong>, died in December 2021 after suffering from a brain tumor.</p><p>While Carey and Cannon coparent their kids, the musician doesn’t involve herself with her ex’s growing brood.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Mariah <a href=#>doesn’t keep up</a> with Nick’s babies and baby mamas,” a source exclusively told Us Weekly last month. “There’s too many to keep up with! She’s happy for him and wishes him the best.”</p><p>When it comes to her parenting style, Carey told Us in 2021 that she’s a “cool mom.”</p><p>“I’m going to have to quote&nbsp;Mean Girls and be, like, ‘I’m not a regular mom. I’m a cool mom.’ There <a href=#>are no rules</a> in this house,” she explained at the time. “No, there are rules in this house, that’s the difference. Like, I want to be that — I don’t like being the bad guy, I have to say. I really don’t, like, I hate that more than anything. So, you know, I do want to be, like, ‘I’m not really a mom, I’m a cool mom.’ But you’re never a cool mom, like, you just never are.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6Kus7XAoWScmaKaxm6wwK6eoayVp3quu82rpp5lo6W8s8CMppitm5ieu6h5wauYopyjYq6vsIycrKuko2Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
