I’m with family continuing to slowly recover and staying very positive as I know this recovery is a long and slow process.”</p><p>Last week, the family shared that Retton is out of the hospital. She had a rare pneumonia that made it hard for her to breathe, and she couldn’t breathe on her own. It was a tough time but now she’s getting better at home after spending weeks in the hospital.</p><p>According to her daughter, McKenna Kelley, it might take a while for her to recover and be back to 100% healthfully.</p><p>On October 18, her daughters shared that she faced a setback in getting better, even though she had started to improve before. A few days ago, <a href=# rel=noopener>they shared on Instagram</a> that Retton’s “breathing is becoming stronger.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Add-a-heading-62.jpg alt="Mary Lou Retton Health Update" width=1200 height=675 title="Mary Lou Retton Health Update: What Did She Say About Her Condition?" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2 id=is-mary-lou-retton-getting-better>Is Mary Lou Retton Getting Better?</h2><p>She was in the hospital, but now she’s back home and getting better.

The main reason is that the United States doesn’t have a government-based healthcare plan for everyone, unlike many other developed countries.</p><p>In Retton’s case, she might have chosen not to get health insurance, maybe because she doesn’t have a full-time job with employer subsidies, or it could be an accidental lapse in coverage. She and her family haven’t explained why she doesn’t have health insurance, and they’re using crowdfunding to pay for her medical expenses.</p><p>You can&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>follow our Twitter account</a> for more information related to other stars’ health, injuries, surgeries, and more.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiulaPBtr7Eo6alrF6YvK57kWlpbGdhZXx0fY6mmKuxXaG8tnnRnqutp55itaaty62fZq2gma61sY4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
