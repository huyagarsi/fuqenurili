But fresh capital would help it in its ongoing battle with messaging app Line for leadership of Japan’s online manga market.</p><p>Webtoons, comic strips designed for consumption on smart phones, are believed to have originated in South Korea in 2003. But they found Japan to be a fertile market, thanks to the country’s long tradition of manga (comics) and anime (animated series and films).</p><p>Digital manga sales soared during the COVID-19 pandemic. And Piccoma’s monthly readership hit a June 2022 high of 9.5 million, compared with about 2 million in August 2017. But the growth surge has slowed and the cost of marketing to and acquiring new users has risen.</p><p>That is leading Korean and Japanese comics firms to target overseas markets, where the webtoon phenomenon is at an earlier stage and growth comes more cheaply.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6tonJmctrWty2aaqKWZmMBussirpGajkaCusHnPopqcp52WeqWxy5qwrGWZpbxw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
