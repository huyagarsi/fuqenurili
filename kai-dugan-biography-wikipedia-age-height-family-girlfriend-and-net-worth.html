His parents have worked hard to keep his life as normal as possible since his birth. While being the son of a Hollywood A-lister has its advantages, the constant exposure to the spotlight can be disastrous.</p><p>Unlike many other celebrities’ children, he has not actively sought out controversies. Paparazzi rarely photograph him. Connelly was previously married to her ‘The Rocketeer’ (1991) co-star Billy Campbell for five years.</p><p>They split up sometime in 1996. Soon after, on a rock-climbing trip, she met photographer David Dugan. They later began dating, and she became pregnant with Kai. The family had been living under one roof since his birth.</p><p>Dugan and Connelly allegedly split up in December 1997, prompting him to leave the house. Despite their divorce, they remain close friends and share custody of their son. Kai, according to Connelly, spends his weekends with his father.</p><p>Jennifer Connelly, Kai’s mother, is originally from Cairo, New York. She began her career as a child model in the world of glamour. She made her film debut in Sergio Leone’s epic crime drama ‘Once Upon a Time in America’ in 1984.</p><p>In the years since, she has established herself as a versatile actress, playing a variety of roles in films such as the mystery horror ‘Phenomena’ (1985), musical fantasy ‘Labyrinth’ (1986), romantic comedy ‘Career Opportunities’ (1991), period action-adventure ‘The Rocketeer’ (1991), science fiction thriller ‘Dark City (1998), and drama ‘Requiem for a Dream (1998). (2000).</p><p>She won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress in 2002 for her role as Alicia Nash in the biographical drama film ‘A Beautiful Mind.’ Her recent film credits include the mystery horror film ‘Dark Water,’ the biblical epic ‘Noah,’ and the cyberpunk action-adventure ‘Alita: Battle Angel’ (2019).</p><p>Several publications, including ‘Time,’ ‘Vanity Fair,’ ‘Esquire,’ and the ‘Los Angeles Times,’ have named Connelly one of the world’s most beautiful women. There is little information available about Kai’s father, David Dugan, before and after his relationship with Connelly.</p><p>He accompanied her to the premiere of her 1997 coming-of-age film ‘Inventing the Abbotts’ when they were together. On the set of ‘A Beautiful Mind,’ Connelly met Paul Bettany. They married on January 1, 2003, in Scotland.</p><p>Stellan and Agnes Lark are Kai’s half-siblings as a result of his mother’s relationship with Bettany. Kai’s maternal grandfather, Gerard Karl Connelly, manufactured clothing.</p><p>A Roman Catholic, his ancestors came to America from Ireland and Norway. His maternal grandmother, Eileen or Ilene Connelly, is an antique dealer. She is Jewish with roots in Poland and Russia.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=kai-dugan-girlfriend-wife-dating></span>Kai Dugan Girlfriend, Wife, Dating<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Dugan has not gone public with her relationship, it is not publicly known whether she is married or in a relationship.
