The person wondered: “Do you take your photos yourself?” Ammika responded by yes and added, “self-timer.”</p><p>A supporter said this: “Love how all your photos are so soft on color and go with the overall esthetics of your page 🔥 it’s inspiring!”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CE9yPDEgwh_/</p><p>While another stated: “I have read about this latest iPhone when it comes to picture taking and videos; it’s an truly amazing phone. One of the most naturally beautiful women I have ever seen. Vibration is even amazing to keep that relaxation and inner peace going 💗👑🌹😘.”</p><p>Ammika recently got some good news — it has been revealed that Chris has finally ended the Rihanna chapter of his life.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CFSa0aTgJ_7/</p><p>After Oprah Winfrey shared an old interview of Rihanna on Oprah’s SuperSoul Conversations podcast, a source revealed this about the odd situation: “Chris wasn’t aware that the podcast was released again, but he has no plans of reaching out to Rihanna about it regardless. He’s focused on his own thing and attempting to move on. He is also sure she’s doing her own thing and wouldn’t want to bother her.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CFkbTSTgsUT/</p><p>The source went on to explain: “Their paths haven’t really crossed as of late. He has become a father and has had many relationships since the interview and since they have dated. And people have to know that what happened between them was in 2009.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CFfBGBCAljK/</p><p>The person concluded by: “Chris has changed. He’s happy that they’ve both achieved the level of success in their lives that they have both professionally and personally and that they can be friends. He always wishes her the best in life, and there’s really nothing more to it. He can’t imagine that they will ever be together romantically again. It would be too much for both of them, and he is OK with that being the case.”</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Ammika is doing her own thing regardless of the drama.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeTnb%2Bqv4ybqaivnqh6o63BsmSmmZ2WeqK5zKKimmWYlr%2BztdJmqZ6ulZa5tHnToZxmq5WYv6bAjJucoaGemXqpsdFmp56qlpqwtXnPoaatp6NirqfAxKtkoJ2kqbavs4yspqadXZy8sLCMp5ywq12eu7e7y6%2Bgp59dp7aprc2nmGZsZGV%2BeoKO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
