The <a href=#>“Dance Again” singer</a> shared the wedding details on her website, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">OnTheJLo</a>. Lopez posted several photos of the event and wrote, “We did it. Love is beautiful. Love is kind. And it turns out love is patient. Twenty years patient.”</p><p>Lopez has legally <a href=#>changed her name to Jennifer Affleck</a>, prompting fans to come up with a wave of new nicknames like “J. Flo” and “J. Fleck.” The name change also reminded fans that the <a href=#>Jersey Girl star</a> isn’t the first celebrity to have the moniker Jennifer Affleck.&nbsp;</p><p>Ben Affleck’s <a href=#>ex-wife, Jennifer Garner</a>, also legally changed her name to Jennifer Affleck while married to the <a href=#>Good Will Hunting</a> star.

Did she even know they were getting married, or did she find out with the rest of the world?&nbsp;</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a>, Affleck told Garner about the wedding just 72 hours (at most) before it took place. “Ben did tell Jen about the wedding, but I’m told that it was only Friday at the earliest,” the insider said. “It was very, very minimally planned in advance and was largely spur-of-the-moment.”</p><p>The source added that one of Affleck and Garner’s children did not attend the event, saying, “Violet stayed home because she’s extremely loyal to her mom.”</p><p>The insider also shared that the couple rushed the wedding because Lopez didn’t want to risk the <a href=#>Gone Girl star</a> getting “cold feet.” “[Lopez] has been ready to get married since the night that Ben proposed,” the source revealed. “She wanted to lock this down and remove any chance for cold feet ASAP!”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><h2 id=h-the-actor-previously-said-feeling-trapped-in-his-marriage-led-to-drinking><strong>The actor previously said feeling ‘trapped’ in his marriage led to drinking</strong></h2><p>Before marrying Jennifer Lopez, Ben Affleck opened up about his marriage to Jennifer Garner. He claimed he would still be drinking if he had stayed married to the <a href=#>13 Going on 30</a> star.</p><p>“We probably would’ve ended up at each other’s throats. I probably still would’ve been drinking,” the actor said during an interview for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">SiriusXM’s The Howard Stern Show</a> (via <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a>). “Part of why I started drinking was because I was trapped.”</p><p>He added, “I was like, ‘I can’t leave because of my kids, but I’m not happy, what do I do?’ And what I did was drank a bottle of scotch and fell asleep on the couch, which turned out not to be the solution.”</p><p>Affleck insisted that <a href=#>his relationship with Garner</a> ended on good terms, despite the media sensationalizing their divorce. “Everything you read was bulls***. The truth was we took our time, we made our decision … We grew apart,” he said. “We had a marriage that didn’t work. This happens. She’s somebody I love and respect, but to whom I shouldn’t be married any longer.”</p><p>Affleck added that he and Garner were both good parents, saying, “I knew she was a good mom. I always hoped she knew I was a good dad. I knew I was.”</p><p><strong>RELATED: </strong><a href=#><strong>Jennifer Garner’s Boyfriend: Is She Still Dating John Miller Amid Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez’s Steamy Romance?</strong></a>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOm5ynZZGbs62xwqRkq52gpL%2B1scOlsGasn6GxbrbEp6WinpWneqit0aecq2WRl7y2wIyhoKxlo6XCs3nOn2StoJViurC5xKerZq%2BVmbGqusZmoa6rpGK1sMHRrGSbnZakv6Z5yK1koZmgpbKvscNo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
