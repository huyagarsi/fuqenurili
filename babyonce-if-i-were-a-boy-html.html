Have you managed to calm down since? If not, you are in good company: The Babyoncé announcement broke Twitter records, charmed the surly Justin Vernon (<a href=#>“That is awesome as shit, culturally speaking”</a>), and even inspired the usually very private Jay-Z to <a href=#>smile, and then salute his wife</a>, in public. Clearly, this is not your average celebrity pregnancy. It’s the first child of arguably the coolest (sorry, Obamas) celebrity couple in the country, both at the top of their musical games — or at least very convenient moments in their respective album cycles. The ever-savvy Beyoncé and Jay-Z made the most of the news, keeping rumors remarkably quiet, then dropping the baby bomb center stage at the VMAs, with a tummy rub and some background screaming from Kanye. How could we resist such fanfare? The answer is: we cannot. So Vulture has done what needs doing and given the forthcoming child its dedicated anthem, the “If I Were a Boy (Remix),” told from the perspective of the baby, because obviously the kid needs a jam straight out of the womb (and we couldn’t help ourselves). Additionally, since we’ll be covering Babyoncé regularly, we wanted to make sure that Babyoncé is the consensus nickname: In the interest of comprehensiveness, we have rounded up most of the options currently in contention. Please, let us know which you prefer, and feel free to add your own.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-0894ad93b7c09054205dbbebc949dc37-3-0-0@published data-word-count=39>Here are the lyrics to Babyoncé (or your preferred nickname)’s first hit, “If I Were I a Boy (the Remix),” sung to the tune of <a href=#>the original</a>.
