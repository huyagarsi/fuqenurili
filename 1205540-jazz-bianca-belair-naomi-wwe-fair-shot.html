Here are some highlights from the interview:</p><p>I just don’t think they’re given a fair chance. Naomi you know I believe she deserves to be treated better. Sasha, right now, she’s kind of being taken care of in a sense. But there’s a few more. You know, Bianca I think she can kick everybody’s ass on the main roster. Will she ever have the opportunity? Will they ever give her that opportunity? I don’t know.</p><p>We were killing some of the men’s ratings and they tried to set us up for failure. We were, I guess no matter how you look at it, just still considered a gimmick match. At that time, you really couldn’t voice your opinion too much. We actually spoke up a few times, but we just try to go out there and show each Monday night or each house show that we deserve the respect. We deserve to be here. Just had to prove ourselves and now look.</p><p dir=ltr>I was on the road on [ECW] house shows, and they had me doing run-ins on Kelly Kelly in a bikini. I run out there, just slam her ass real quick, and get a big pop. Then they came back and told me, “you’re supposed to be a heel!” And I’m like, “this is the ECW crowd. This is where Jazz was born. Hey, I can’t help it, you know.” I don’t know if that’s why I didn’t work out because I got a babyface pop or what.</p><p dir=ltr>For more from the interview, be sure to check out the full show embedded below:</p><p></p><p>Thanks to our friends at Ring the Belle for the above transcriptions!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZFpbG5sYGK3osbZZpmimZ6Yrm6uxKWYoqpdo66wuchmrrCdXZuuqr6MrJ%2BorA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
