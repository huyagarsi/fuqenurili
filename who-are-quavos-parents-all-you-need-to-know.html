According to&nbsp;TMZ, an argument started between Quavo and others after the rapper lost a dice game. The debate, which became about who was the better basketball player, continued outside.&nbsp;</p><p>The outlet claims that as Quavo walked away, someone threw a punch, sparking a melee in which at least 10 shots were fired. Takeoff sustained fatal gunshot wounds to the torso and head, the Harris County Medical Examiner’s Office said.&nbsp;</p><h3>Migos were raised by Quavo’s mother, Edna Marshall</h3><p>Quavo (real name Quavious Keyate Marshall) was born on 2nd April 1991 in Athens, Georgia, to Edna Marshall. His father, like Offset’s and TakeOff’s, left when he was young.&nbsp;</p><p>Offset and Takeoff moved into Edna’s house after the family relocated from Athens to Gwinnett County.&nbsp;“We always stayed in the same house. We share everything,”&nbsp;Quavo told&nbsp;Fader. “He’s [Takeoff] basically like my brother.”</p><p>“I don’t look at him [Quavo] as an uncle,”&nbsp;Takeoff said,&nbsp;“but more as my brother.”&nbsp;Quavo told&nbsp;Rolling Stone&nbsp;that Edna didn’t complain about raising three teenage boys:&nbsp;</p><p>“She knew how to raise you as a man. She had a house full of niggas playing games, shoes off, eating all the food, and it’s hard times – but she never complained.”</p><p>Quavo and Takeoff repaid Edna by buying her a house in 2017.&nbsp;“ME and Take Jus Bought Mama A House!!! Tha Big Way!!!,”&nbsp;Quavo tweeted. When the trio moved out, they made the studio their home. Music executive Pierre Thomas told&nbsp;The New York Times:&nbsp;</p><p>“What made me really want to go hard for them is that they packed all their clothes and moved into the studio – literally lived there, sleeping on reclining chairs and making music all day.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHqivsRmqK6ZpqTAbrzAq5ynrKNirq24jLKmrmWemrKledOoZKSmn6x8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
