It is also those very personality traits that make it even more surprising when you see her in roles like Sin City. But it is stepping outside of what people expect that mas made Alexis Bledel so exceptional an actress in the first place. Though many may remember her for Gilmore Girls, that little girl has grown and matured into an incredible talent. Here are five things you didn’t know about Alexis Bledel.</p><p><strong>That Is Only Part Of Her Name</strong></p><p>Her real name is Kimberly Alexis Bledel. I know that doesn’t change much, but she dropped the Kimberly early on for mostly unknown reasons. But this means we have all been calling her by her middle name this whole time. Still, though. That is a craft way to change your name and get a stage name without needing to actually change your name. Shows how ahead of the crop she is.</p><p><strong>Born in Texas</strong></p><p>Once you realize fact number two, fact number one makes so much more sense. Having three names is a big part of how naming goes in Texas. Everything is bigger in Texas, even the names! But in all seriousness, Alex Bledel attended Catholic school there, which led to her realizing she needed to overcome her shyness. This leads us right into fact three.</p><p><strong>Tried Community Theater To Overcome Shyness</strong></p><p>A big part of her character on the Gilmore Girls was how shy and reserved she seemed. This is actually a lot like Bledel in real life. She had done some modeling by this point, but was still incredibly shy. Her parents thought community theater and getting her n stage might get her past that shyness. Once she hit the stage, the shyness slowly was overcome by a love for the craft of acting.</p><p><strong>Got Engaged To Fellow Actor&nbsp;<a title="Vincent Kartheiser" href=#>Vincent Kartheiser</a>&nbsp;Last Year</strong></p><p>Best known as her co-star on Mad Men, these two met and sparks flew. Though they kept things under wraps for awhile, once word got out, they announced that two had planned on marrying. Though they are still keeping wedding date a secret as of right now. As many of you know, Alexis Bledel is quite guarded about her personal life. Don’t expect that to change anytime soon. It is a big part of her appeal.</p><p><strong>Uncredited Role in Rushmore</strong></p><p>I am sure you are all familiar with the Wes Anderson classic, Rushmore. But did you know Alexis Bledel was in that movie? Truth is, her role is uncredited, which is usually either reserved for a huge star who is embaressed they are in a movie. Or someone who just played a walk by or an extra. We are pretty sure in this case it is the second one. It is still fun to watch the film with this knowledge and try to find her in all the scenes with students (which is most of the film). Trust us, she is in there.</p><p>(Photo by Boneau/Bryan-Brown via Getty Images)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGidoq6VYsGptc2gqmacmZm7tXnKp6awZZGhsrm10maZpZ2Umrlw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
