It’s a reminder to the man I love to take care of himself but also that in difficult times I’ll always be there in his corner.”</p><p>“I also dedicate the record to my uncle David Cherry that passed during the making of this song. He was a musician and I felt him guiding me musically during the session to be braver and bolder with my songwriting.”</p><p><strong>Check out the lyric video for ‘Vitamins’ below:</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>‘Vitamins’ sees the BRIT Award winner go back to her R&B roots – much to the delight of fans who were quick to react to news of the singles release online, with one writing: “I’M SO EXCITED MABEL!”</p><p>Another added: “New music on my birthday? I’m winning!” Whilst a third follower commented: “Your music is my vitamin of choice.”</p><p>Earlier this year, the 28-year old revealed to fans on Instagram that she decided to take time out to focus on her personal life and to make new music.</p><p>“I’ve spent the last 18 months focusing on my family, my health, my happiness and of course my MUSIC,” the singer wrote to fans. “I started my career almost ten years ago and moments of peace have been far and few between. I don’t really know if anyone knows who they are in their 20s but the only way for me to start figuring that out was to turn down the noise.”</p><p>“The peace has brought me clarity but that wouldn’t have happened without the help of my amazing family, my beautiful man, his family, our wonderful friends and of course YOU.”</p><p>“Don’t think that I don’t see your messages wondering where I am, how I am or asking for music and don’t underestimate how much that means to me. You are my why. Like why do I even do this when it scares the s**t out of me sometimes. YOU are why!”</p><p><strong>‘Vitamins’ is out via Polydor Records now and available to stream <a href=#>here</a>.</strong></p><h4 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Let us know your thoughts on Mabel over on ‘X’ (formerly Twitter) <a href=#>@CelebMix</a> now!</strong></h4><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51kuqKuxKVkppmbmsBusc%2Bimmabn6Kyo63CpGSwoaSdeq%2Bx1maqoqaXobJuwsitmKahnqh8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
