The celebrity’s father recently spoke with <a href=#>The Sun</a> about his son’s family.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bckonline.com/elements/uploads/2021/01/nick-cannon.jpg alt width=640 height=462 sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>“I believe children are blessings,” James shared. “And I teach my son, ‘Make as much money as you can, and have as many children as you can,'” Mr. Cannon added. “I would fight for family. I’m pro-life,” James further explained. “I wrote a book called Stop Hating: Can I Live?, which is Nick’s story.”</p><p><a href=#>Nick Cannon</a> made a song called Can I Live?, a few years back. The track delved into the entertainment mogul’s mother, Beth Gardner, and her decision to not have an abortion when she was pregnant with Nick. “The music industry actually backed off of him because of this video,” James told The Sun.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bckonline.com/elements/uploads/2021/06/nick-cannon-1.jpg alt width=640 height=374 sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>“If Nick can provide those kids with culture, with love, God and life,” Mr. Cannon continued. “And I’d say if a woman is worth having sex with, she’s worth having a baby with. That’s what I’m teaching my sons. Let her be of quality, don’t sleep with women you wouldn’t have babies with, you’re tripping.”</p><p><a href=#>Nick Cannon has six kids</a> and is expecting his seventh child to arrive later this year. Wild ‘N Out model Alyssa Scott revealed Nick as the father of her unborn child on Father’s Day. Meanwhile, Abby De La Rosa welcomed twin sons Zion and Zillion a few days ago. The youngsters made Nick’s kids with Brittany Bell, Powerful and Golden, older siblings. Nick’s kids with ex-wife Mariah Carey, Monroe and Moroccan, have also been made older siblings several times over by their father.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bckonline.com/elements/uploads/2021/05/nick-cannon-baby-mama.jpg alt width=640 height=436 sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>James Cannon, though happy about his son’s efforts to make money and have a big family, admitted to The Sun that <a href=#>Nick</a> has quite the journey ahead as the father of kids with multiple women. “If you stay with one woman it could be easy,” James shared. “If it’s going to be boom, boom, boom [with different women], you have to factor in that journey,” Mr. Cannon admitted.</p><p>Nick Cannon and Alyssa Scott have decided to name their baby Zen Cannon. The little one will be Nick’s fourth child in less than a year.</p><p>Photo: Nick Cannon/Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiak6C8r7jIp5xnm5%2BifHN8kWpmaW5fZ4JwusicomabkaO7sLrSZpuanF2orrq%2FjKGcZqulpb2wvtOsZKGho2LAsLqMoZivoZ6ceq6tzbJkpKGUqHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
