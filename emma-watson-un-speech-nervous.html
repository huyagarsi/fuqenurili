"It felt like: 'Am I going to have lunch with these people, or am I going to be eaten? Am I the lunch?'"The actress explained how she was using her stardom for the good of her cause. "<strong>Fame is not something I have always felt comfortable with</strong>," said Emma. "I have really grappled with it emotionally. And, in a funny way, doing this is my way of making sense of the fame, of using it. I have found a way to channel it towards something else, which makes it so much more manageable for me. And this is something I really believe in."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/aefea1a33f3b-emma-watson2-z.jpg><p id=eRxOTVIjS5ha data-wc=12><strong>Emma Watson admitted that she hasn't always been comfortable with her fame</strong></p><p id=eqmcFkiRMo6h data-wc=123>Her attitude is something she picked up from a young age, when, sitting around the dinner table, Emma was raised to believe that her opinion was valuable. "My mum and I spoke as loudly as my brothers," she said. Last month, the Paris-born beauty reinforced her feminist views in a <a class=hm-link href=#>rousing speech</a> delivered at the New York United Nations headquarters. "<strong>You might be thinking who is this girl?</strong>" said Emma. "And what is she doing up on stage at the UN. It's a good question and trust me I have been asking myself the same thing. I don't know if I am qualified to be here. All I know is that I care about this problem. And I want to make it better."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c4127364db34-emma-watson3-z.jpg><p id=eifyWkCA2KaD data-wc=15><strong>Emma Watson added that as a child she always spoke 'as loudly' as her brothers</strong>&nbsp;</p><p id=eFAsMtF_nW7S data-wc=82>Emma warned her audience not to confuse feminism – "an unpopular word" – with "man-hating" and called on men to support her fight for gender equality. "<strong>I want men to take up this mantle</strong>," she said. "So their daughters, sisters and mothers can be free from prejudice but also so that their sons have permission to be vulnerable and human too – reclaim those parts of themselves they abandoned and in doing so be a more true and complete version of themselves."</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
