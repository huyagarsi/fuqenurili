The last time the How I Met Your Mother donned a two-piece (<a href=#>on Sept. 19</a> to be exact), she was photographed stretching with her arms over her head, which made her ribs stick out, sparking much discussion online about whether she was too skinny.</p><p>New photos, taken on Monday, Sept. 30 in Hawaii, prove the 39-year-old actress is healthy and in perfect shape. The mom of two girls showed off her washboard abs and slim figure in a pink and purple print two-piece as she played in the water with her 4-year-old <strong>Satyana</strong> and actor husband <strong>Alexis Denisof</strong>, 47.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Hannigan, looking relaxed after attending last week's Emmys in support of her CBS sitcom — and costar/show host <a href=#><strong>Neil Patrick Harris</strong></a> — wore aviator sunglasses and kept her face free of makeup. Wearing her hair down and naturally wavy, she looked at least ten years younger than she is.</p><p>The happy couple plan to renew their vows after Denisof, whom Hannigan met on the set of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, re-proposed to her in July and gave her a new diamond ring. "This time we'll involve our children, which I'm so looking forward to," Hannigan explained during an appearance on The View Sept 17. "My 4-year-old is so excited because she gets to be the flower girl and the maid-of-honor. It's going to be very small, but lovely and intimate."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGaapKmovK95x5qlp6GXlrtuw86wqmahnmK9qrrKZqqtqpmjtG6uyKSgp6FdnrtutMCwmKKhXWd9cn%2BQamdo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
