“I’ve worked and chatted with him,” the Saturday Night Live personality, 34, told Page Six on Thursday, December 1, of Davidson, 29. “I find him deeply charming. And I remember my first year [on SNL], going to all my girlfriends and being like, ‘I get it’ [after I met him]."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The New York native <a href=#>was engaged to Grande, 29, between June and October 2018</a>, who notably <a href=#>gushed about the impressive girth of her then-fiancé’s penis</a>. Davidson quickly became an unlikely sex symbol, <a href=#>known for his “big dick energy.”</a></p><p class=p1>“I don’t hate it,” he quipped to&nbsp;<i>Variety</i>&nbsp;in August 2018. “I’m <a href=#>just really, really happy</a>, and if that means I have big dick energy, then sick. My favorite thing was my mom was like, ‘Peter, they’re saying you had a big penis just like your father.’ What the f–k!”</p><p class=p1>Following his split from the&nbsp;<i>Victorious&nbsp;</i>alum — who has since married <a href=#><strong>Dalton Gomez</strong></a> — Davidson<a href=#> eventually moved on with the 42-year-old Skims mogul</a>. The&nbsp;<i>Meet Cute&nbsp;</i>star initially connected with Kardashian <a href=#>during her October 2021&nbsp;<i>SNL&nbsp;</i>hosting debut</a>, where they shared a sweet stage kiss.</p><p class=p1>“He seems super charming, he’s vulnerable, he’s lovely, his fingernail polish is awesome,” Ratajkowski, 31, gushed <a href=#>during a November 2021 appearance on&nbsp;</a><i><a href=#>Late Night With Seth Meyers</a>&nbsp;</i>about Davidson’s appeal as a boyfriend amid his romance with the reality TV star. “Like, he looks good, he’s great. … I&nbsp;think Pete’s got the height. Obviously, women find him very attractive [and he has a] good relationship with his mother.”</p><p class=p1>The&nbsp;<i>I Feel Pretty&nbsp;</i>actress’ comments came less than one year before <a href=#>Davidson and Kardashian’s August split</a>. He <a href=#>has since moved on with&nbsp;Ratajkowski</a>, which&nbsp;<i>Us Weekly&nbsp;</i>exclusively confirmed last month.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“Pete and Emily just dig each other,” a source <a href=#>exclusively told&nbsp;<i>Us&nbsp;</i>in November</a>&nbsp;of the new pair’s “fun” romance. “[They] find the vibe they have very easy and free-flowing. [There’s] just a lot of fun and a chance to cut loose and see where it leads. There’s no doubt Pete loves a challenge and he’s certainly met his intellectual match in Emily.”</p><p class=p1>While neither Davidson nor the&nbsp;<i>My Body&nbsp;</i>author have addressed their connection, they <a href=#>made their public debut at the November 27 New York Knicks game</a> and were all smiles in their courtside seats.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasppyoeqS0y6icZp6Zo7Kurc1mrKeclafAta3Nnapmr5iuerGx055knZmmnrG0u81mmqGZoqLAbsPOppynZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
