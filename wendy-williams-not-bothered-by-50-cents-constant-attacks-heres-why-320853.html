50’s latest attack was him badly photoshopping Wendy’s head on another woman back hugging him and writing ‘Nightmare on Elm Street’ under it."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

She was expecting it because she knows that he likes going back and forth with her. Wendy was not offended she has a good sense of humor, she can take a joke. If he wants to post pictures of them cuddled up on his Instagram page, who is she to argue.’</p><p>‘It’s starting to seem like he is a little obsessed with her and Wendy is actually starting to enjoy the attention from him. If 50 thinks he is upsetting her, he is way wrong.’</p><p>Since her talk show comes back for a new season tomorrow, September 16, it is safe to say that Wendy has the platform to fire back at the rapper if she wanted to.</p><p>However, it seems like she would rather not give him the attention and satisfaction of knowing he is getting to her.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Sure enough, ‘50 knows that he will have any clap back needed and ready if she ever goes after him on the talk show. It makes him happy to know he gets under her skin and will always be on her case.’</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGenmrulxYywoKWkmZa6tHnNqKtmmp%2Bptaa%2BxJ1km7Fdan1ur8Snq6xlk6S7tMDAp6tmmaSprqS30mafnqqVqHq4tNhmamtoaGqAcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
