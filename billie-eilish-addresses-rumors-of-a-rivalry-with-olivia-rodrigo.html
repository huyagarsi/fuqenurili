After all, tension and fallings-out are common fodder for the stars of today, and it's rare to see rock-solid friendships between the main ladies of pop music — perhaps the enduring <a href=#>bond between Taylor Swift and Selena Gomez</a> is the exception to this rule.</p><p>But in a recent interview with Elle​​​​​​, Eilish <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">firmly put to bed any speculation</a> that she might be harboring a secret grudge against the "good 4 u" songstress. Speaking to the magazine, the star expressed frustration at the Hollywood culture that tries to pit women against one another, saying, "It's sad because girls are trained to be in competition with each other."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Billie Eilish's 10 Best Responses To Her Haters And Critics</a></span></p><p>Eilish and Rodrigo have also recently fought off rumors of a rivalry — something that is perhaps perpetuated by the comparisons made between the two stars by their respective fanbases on Twitter — by posting photos together at the "bad guy" singer's album release party. Eilish <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">captioned a series of shots</a> including one where she is hugging Rodrigo, "this is where the real love is." And the "brutal" singer has also previously <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">been papped in Eilish's merch</a> while out and about.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Everything Olivia Rodrigo Has Been Accused Of Copying... So Far</a></span></p><p>Some fans are hoping for a Taylena-esque friendship to spring up between the two hitmakers, now that it's clear they aren't feuding. One replied to Eilish's comments, writing, "ugh I love them", while another tweeted, "need these queens to collab".</p><p>Elsewhere in her interview, Eilish spoke on several other topics, including her surprising reason for dying her hair blonde — "I wanted anonymity" — and why she finds it so hard to be on social media. The star also addressed the controversy that ensued when she debuted a new look while covering the May edition of British Vogue. Eilish suggested that her decision to don a corset in the photos, a sharp departure from her previously baggy and oversized signature style, ultimately cost her 10,000 Instagram followers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite her annoyance at the reaction to her Vogue photoshoot, which she blamed on "a very sexist world where women are put into categories", the star was nevertheless able to look on the bright side of her ordeal, joking that, "people are scared of big boobs."</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Billie Eilish Reveals Massive Dragon Tattoo In Thigh-High Slit Dress</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZoqScnrJusciloKygXZaxpb7ErKqeq12nwq670axkqJ5dlnqztdWao6uxXay2tbSMqKOirpmWerO7w6ugoKdf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
