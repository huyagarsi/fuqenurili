As well as singing his gorgeous single “Over and Over Again”, Nathan wowed Patrick and listeners alike with a spellbinding cover of Adele’s “Hello”.
When introducing his Adele cover, Nathan said that he was “either brave, or stupid or both!” to cover such a massive song. He also said that a lot of people have covered it and he was “just joining the party by attempting to cover the song”."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He also said that a lot of people have covered it and he was “just joining the party by attempting to cover the song”.&nbsp;Nathan LOVES to challenge himself and they don’t come much bigger than singing Adele.</p><p>However Nathan did a phenomenal job of the song, which really suited his rich voice. This song really highlighted his&nbsp;insane riffs and vocal range&nbsp;well. Afterwards, Patrick told listeners that Nathan put his thumb up to seek his approval, which Patrick laughed off by declaring&nbsp;it as&nbsp;“sensational, absolutely unbelievable”.</p><p></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>What a brilliant version of <a href=#>@Adele</a>'s smash hit <a href=#>#Hello</a> by <a href=#>@NathanSykes</a>! Who enjoyed that? <a href=#>https://t.co/m6qFNypIBn</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/34gsNBRsnI</a></p><p>— BBC Radio 2 (@BBCRadio2) <a href=#>November 29, 2015</a></p><p>Nathan also performed an acoustic version of “Over and Over Again” which seems to get more goosebump inducing every time he sings it.</p><p>He also spoke to Patrick about his perfectionist attitude to his music, declaring his album (which is released next year) as finished however it could be unfinished as he writes new music all the time. He says that there’ll be two sides to&nbsp;him on the album, personal ballads and also a more fun side, in big band style like “Kiss Me Quick”.</p><p>Despite being in the public eye for years, Nathan said that it still takes him by surprise when people stop him in the pub for a picture, however he is happy with people’s reaction to his solo music. Since becoming a solo artist, Nathan has been able to get to know his own voice better by experimenting and challenging himself.</p><p>Nathan also spoke about his upcoming support slot on Little Mix’s tour, saying that he thinks the girls are “incredible vocalists, amazing performers and put on a great show”.</p><p>Catch Nathan’s full&nbsp;interview and acoustic performances of “Over and Over Again” and “Hello” on <a href=#>BBC iPlayer</a>, from the 22 minute mark.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51ku6LAx5qlZqupoLK0ecKorZ6qo2KupbHLnqpmoJWhubB7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
